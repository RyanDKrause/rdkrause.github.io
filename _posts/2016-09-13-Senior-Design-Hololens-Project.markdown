description: Senior Design Unity3D project for Iowa State University 491. I'm on a team of 4 people, and we are working on a game that will run on the Hololens. In our game, you will explore the current building you're in, find and catch monsters, battle against other players and AI, and be the best monster trainer in the world. This project is currently being planned and prototyped, and will be completed in May 2017.
