description: White Elephant Tower Defense was my very first game I ever finished. It was created for a 48 hour Game Jam with the theme "White Elephant." The idea is that elephants are escaping the zoo, and the player needs to build different towers to contain the stampede. Towers have different effects (peanut machines slow, mice traps scare them back), and have different upgrade levels. I created it in Game Maker, a 2D game engine, and was coded in Game Maker Language, a javascript-eqsue language. It was my first game and I'm really proud of it, as it marks the start of my game development journey. <p><a href="downloads/WhiteElephantTowerD.zip">Download the game</a></p>
