description: A Unity3D video game on the Hololens for the Iowa State University Game Dev. Capstone course. I'm on a team of 4, and we are currently planning and prototyping a Trading Card Game that runs on the Microsoft Hololens. Using the power of Hololens, we can display the card monsters to the player, to make the game more immersive. This project will be finished in May 2017.
