description: Minicade is an arcade for minigames, simple as that. But the thing that makes this special, is all minigames are created by the community. Using my Unity Package anyone can make a minigame. With Minicade, I hope to help get more people into Game Development, without having to plan a large game.  <p><a href="https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/isu-gdc/minicade" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>
