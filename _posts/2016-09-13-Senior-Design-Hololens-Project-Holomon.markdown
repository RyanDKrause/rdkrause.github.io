description: Senior Design Unity3D project for Iowa State University 491. I am the Team Leader of three others, and we are working on a game that will run on the Hololens. In our game, you will explore the current building you're in, find and catch monsters, battle against other players and AI, and be the best monster trainer in the world. This project is currently being planned and prototyped, and will be completed in May 2017. More information such as design documents and weekly reports and can be viewed at the website below. Our goal for this project is to provide research data on the capabilities of the Hololens, so that we may help other developers in the future, and help shape the direction the Hololens is heading for future apps.
