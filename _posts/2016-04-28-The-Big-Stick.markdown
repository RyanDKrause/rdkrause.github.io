description: The Big Stick was a Unity3D group project in my ComS 437 class. Our client, the head of the U.S.S. Iowa Battleship museum in California, tasked us to create a game relating to the U.S.S. Iowa. I worked on a team of 4 people, and we created a museum installation game, where players connect to the world map using their smartphone. Once connected, they can control their personal battleship, sink enemy ships, and capture control points.
