description: Reversi was assigned in my ComS 437 class. It was programmed in Unity and C#. The main goal of this project was to create an AI that was smart enough to beat my teacher. I used a Min-Maxing that looked anywhere between 1 to 12 moves ahead, but because of the exponential growth of moves, above 7 moves the game slows down.
