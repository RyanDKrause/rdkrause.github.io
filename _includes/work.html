					<p>Software Developer Intern</p>
					<p><i>May 2016 - Aug 2016</i></p>
					<p>As an Intern, I worked with a team of 10 developers on creating an iOS application in Obj-C, a new language for me. This application pulled data from different areas within Epic's database to display to the user. At the end of the summer, I presented my project to a large group of other interns and employees.</p>

					<p>Summer Assistant</p>
					<p><i>June 2015 - Aug 2015</i></p>
					<p>This was a summer job in which I taught Engineering concepts to kids ages 5-12 using Legos. For example, I would build and explain the different parts of a catapult, then have the kids build their best catapult that could shoot the farthest and most accurately. I learned how to take complicated engineering concepts and explain it so that little kids would be able to understand.</p>
