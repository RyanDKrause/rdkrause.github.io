						My short term goals, within the next one or two years, are to finish school,
						then to get a job at a game development company. Long term, I would hope to be
						settled/in high standing in an established game dev. company, or have started my own.
						Either way, I would love to have made games that are common household names that people
						know and love. That way, I can say "I worked on that" and feel super proud of it.

						In my general education elective classes, one of the most important skills I've learned
						is the ability to communicate well with others in an clear and efficient manner. In most
						engineering problems, engineers aren't the only people involved. For example, there's project
						managers, testers, shareholders, etc. who don't always have a technical mindset. In Speech class,
						English 212, we're taught different ways to explain concepts. Depending on our audience, we have
						to change our word choice that we use, go into detail on more things, and so on. Because I have to
						clarify differently depending on the situation, I have to understand what I'm explaining on multiple
						levels. Then, with these different audiences and understanding in mind, I have to adapt my explanation
						accordingly. In the end, I understand the project at hand more because of having to explain it in
						multiple ways to multiple people.

						When communicating with others, it's possible that they might give suggestions or ideas that
						you may have originally missed. When getting feedback from others, it makes the end product even 
						better. This better product could have impacts on society that no one may have ever seen before.
						For example, one of the large personal projects I've been working on is Minicade. One of the
						aspects of Minicade is the Minicade Creator, which allows other people to create their own minigames
						for Minicade. Because I'm the one who created it, I may think that something in the creation process is
						easy or self-explanitory. As others tried to create games using it, they voiced some issues with how the
						process was, which led to making the creator even better for everyone. As a result, other developers
						are able to use the Minicade Creator at a higher level than before, which can help them become better
						developers using my tool as practice, which then helps the future of Software Engineering overall.
